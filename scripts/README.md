`/scripts` contains (unmaintained) infrastructure that was used for early testing and development of the Stride protocol. The scripts here support docker-image based testing, some of which are heavily inspired by those used by Osmosis and Quicksilver (although there have been deviations from the original implementations since). The relevant licenses are included here.
