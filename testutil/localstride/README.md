# LocalStride

Inspired by LocalOsmosis, LocalStride is a complete Stride testnet containerized with Docker and orchestrated with a simple docker-compose file. LocalStride comes pre-configured with opinionated, sensible defaults for a standard testing environment.

## 1. Localnet - No Initial State

The following commands must be executed from the root folder of the Stride repository.

1. Make any change to the stride code that you want to test

2. Initialize LocalStride:

```bash
make localnet-init
```

The command:

- Builds a local docker image with the latest changes
- Cleans the `$HOME/.stride` folder

3. Start LocalStride:

```bash
make localnet-start
```

> Note
>
> You can also start LocalStride in detach mode with:
>
> `make localnet-startd`

4. (optional) Add your validator wallet and 10 other preloaded wallets automatically:

```bash
make localnet-keys
```

- These keys are added to your `--keyring-backend test`
- If the keys are already on your keyring, you will get an `"Error: aborted"`
- Ensure you use the name of the account as listed in the table below, as well as ensure you append the `--keyring-backend test` to your txs
- Example: `strided tx bank send ls-test2 stride1kwax6g0q2nwny5n43fswexgefedge033t5g95j --keyring-backend test --chain-id localstride`

5. You can stop the chain, keeping the state with

```bash
make localnet-stop
```

6. When you are done you can clean up the environment with:

```bash
make localnet-clean
```

### LocalStride Accounts

LocalStride is pre-configured with one validator and 10 accounts with stride balances.

## 2. LocalStride - With Mainnet State

A few things to note before getting started. The below method will only work if you are using the same version as mainnet. In other words,
if mainnet is on v8.0.0 and you try to do this on a v9.0.0 tag or on main, you will run into an error when initializing the genesis. What you can do though is run localstride on the mainnet version, then go through the upgrade process to ensure the upgrade with mainnet state goes smoothly.

**Note**: Running localstride with mainnet state is very memory intensive. It is recommended to allocate at least 15GB of memory to docker, otherwise, the node will crash before it can start up.

### Create a mainnet state export

1. Set up a node on mainnet

2. Take a state export snapshot with the following command:

```sh
strided export > state_export.json
```

This will create a file called `state_export.json` which is a snapshot of the current mainnet state.

### Use the state export in LocalStride

3. Copy the `state_export.json` to the `localstride/state_export` folder within the stride repo

```sh
cp state_export.json stride/testutil/localstride/state-export/
```

4. Build the `local:stride` docker image (select yes if prompted to recursively remove):

```bash
cd stride
make localnet-state-export-init
```

The command:

- Builds a local docker image with the latest changes
- Cleans the `$HOME/.stride` folder

5. Start LocalStride:

```bash
make localnet-state-export-start
```

> Note
>
> You can also start LocalStride in detach mode with:
>
> `make localnet-state-export-startd`

When running this command for the first time, `local:stride` will:

- Modify the provided `state_export.json` to create a new state suitable for a testnet
- Start the chain

You will then go through the genesis initialization process and hit the first block (not block 1, but the block number after your snapshot was taken)

During this process, you may see only p2p logs and no blocks. **This could be the case for the next 30 minutes**, but will eventually start hitting blocks.

6. The following account was added to your machine:

```bash
Address:
stride1wal8dgs7whmykpdaz0chan2f54ynythkz0cazc

Mnemonic:
deer gaze swear marine one perfect hero twice turkey symbol mushroom hub escape accident prevent rifle horse arena secret endless panel equal rely payment
```

This account represents a validator that has the majority of voting power with the same state as mainnet state (at the time you took the snapshot)

7. On your host machine, you can now query the state-exported testnet:

```sh
strided status
```

8. Here is an example command to ensure complete understanding:

```sh
strided tx bank send val stride1qym804u6sa2gvxedfy96c0v9jc0ww7593uechw 10000000ustrd --chain-id localstride --keyring-backend test
```

9. You can stop chain, keeping the state with

```bash
make localnet-state-export-stop
```

10. When you are done you can clean up the environment. **Do not do this yet if you are testing the upgrade!**

```bash
make localnet-state-export-clean
```

Note: At some point, all the validators (except yours) will get jailed at the same block due to them being offline.

When this happens, it may take a little bit of time to process. Once all validators are jailed, you will continue to hit blocks as you did before.
If you are only running the validator for a short time (< 24 hours) you will not experience this.

## 3. LocalStride - Mainnet State Upgrade [Internal Only]

This guide will walk through testing an upgrade on a state exported testnet. This is meant to be run internally from Stride Labs where the infrastructure in GCP has already been initialized.

### Create a mainnet state export

1. Log into GCP and start the Biggie Smalls node. This job requires a lot of memory and cannot be done locally.

2. SSH into `biggie-smalls` as user `stride`

3. Build the mainnet `strided`

```bash
  cd stride
  git fetch --all
  git checkout {mainnet-version}
  make install
```

4. Run the setup script to download snapshots and setup the home directory

```bash
cd .. # back into /home/stride
bash setup_node.sh
```

5. Start the node and wait until it's caught up to the head of the network

```
strided start
```

6. Stop your Stride daemon

7. Take a state export snapshot with the following command:

```bash
strided export > state_export.json
```

This will create a file called `state_export.json` which is a snapshot of the current mainnet state.

### Use the state export in LocalStride

1. Copy the `state_export.json` to the `localstride/state_export` folder within the stride repo

```sh
cp state_export.json stride/testutil/localstride/state-export/
```

2. Build the `local:stride` docker image (select yes if prompted to recursively remove):

```bash
cd stride
make localnet-state-export-init
```

The command:

- Builds a local docker image with the latest changes
- Cleans the stride home directories for the two nodes that will be run in docker

7. Start LocalStride:

- Run the startup command which will setup each node. It will take a few minutes to setup and after the configuration and genesis files have been modified.

```bash
make localnet-state-export-start
```

- Peer the two nodes together to finish the setup

```bash
make localnet-state-export-stop
make localnet-state-export-peer
```

- Start up the nodes once more, now that they're peer'd together. It will take a while to start churning blocks!

```bash
make localnet-state-export-start
```

If it starts up successfully, you can kill it with `control + C`

### Testing the upgrade

- Start the network up again in detached mode

```bash
make localnet-state-export-startd
```

- Once localstride starts churning blocks, you are ready to test the upgrade. Run the following to submit and vote on the upgrade:

```bash
# Check the localstride logs to determine the current block
docker logs state-export-stride1-1 --tail 100

# Fix permissions so you can run the script
make localnet-state-export-perms

# Propose and vote on the upgrade
make localnet-state-export-upgrade upgrade_name={upgrade_name}
```

- Wait for the upgrade height and confirm the node crashed. Run the following to take down the container:

```bash
docker logs state-export-stride1-1 -f --tail 100

# One upgrade height is reached and node crashes:
make localnet-state-export-stop
```

- Switch the repo back to the version we're upgrading to and re-build the stride image **without clearing the state**:

```bash
git checkout {latest_branch}
make localnet-state-export-build
```

- Finally, start the node back up with the updated binary

```bash
make localnet-state-export-start
```

```bash
make localnet-state-export-perms
strided export --home /home/stride/.stride1 > testutil/localstride/state-export/state_export_after.json
```

### Comparing Exports

- Update the export JSON paths in `compare_before_after_state.py` and run the script
- For each section of state with a discrepency, manually inspect the difference and ensure that there is a plausible explanation. It is recommended to do this in Jupyter
- If the diffs check out, the localstride testing is complete!
