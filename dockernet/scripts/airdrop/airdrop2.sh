## Test airdrop flow for chains who have non-standard coin types (not type 118). 
#       For example Evmos is using coin type 60, while Stride uses 118. Therefore, we can't map Evmos <> Stride addresses, because the one-way mapping works like this
#           seed phrase  ----> Evmos address (e.g. evmos123z469cfejeusvk87ufrs5520wmdxmmlc7qzuw)
#                        ----> Stride address (e.g. stride19uvw0azm9u0k6vqe4e22cga6kteskdqq3ulj6q)
#           and there is no function that can map between the two addresses.

#         evmos airdrop-test address: cosmos16lmf7t0jhaatan6vnxlgv47h2wf0k5lnhvye5h (rly2)
#            to test, we don't need to use evmos, just an address from a different mnemonic (can come from a coin_type 118 chain) 
#            here we choose to use an osmosis address with a new menmonic since we don't have an Evmos binary set up
