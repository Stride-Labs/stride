## Distribution Custom Modules

Basic distribution module
- withdraw delegator reward could be altered to blacklist addresses from withdrawing rewards, but that would not prevent them from _accruing_ rewards, which we cannot allow https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/blob/main/x/distribution/keeper/msg_server.go
- core logic for distribution: https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/blob/main/x/distribution/keeper/allocation.go, could probably include logic a la community tax that siphens off rewards that would otherwise have gone to the addresses in question, so that they receive 0 rewards. then would need to increase the rewards paid to all other stakers by this amount
    - better solution to this is to blacklist a single validator to receive no rewards, then renormalize all the others so that they are upscaled to receive more rewards!
